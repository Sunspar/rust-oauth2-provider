We have the basis down with the models and sql files for the initial migrations,
we just need to nail down the major components one by one:

- use the todo app in diesel as a starting point for a db pool
- figure out a clean way to return JSON responses from the two post routes
- find a way to abstract out the form you get when accessing GET /oauth/authorize
- find a way to create clients via the web
- examine other grant types, but get client_credentials working first



NOTICE:
  - make sure postgres has the timezone set to UTC in your pg configuration.
